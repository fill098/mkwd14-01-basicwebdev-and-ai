## 💻 What Is Web Development
Building applications that are used on the Internet is called **web development**.  
We build such applications by writing instructions in a programming language that can be understood by the machine that runs them.  
Web development includes building **web sites**, **web services**, and **web solutions**.

---

## 👩‍💻 Developers and What They Do

Solving problems through programming and instructing machines is called **software development**.  
The people who do software development are called **software developers**.  
Groups of instructions to a machine form a **software program**.  
Developers produce solutions to complex problems by building software programs.

### ⚙️ Developers in the Modern World

Today’s developers don’t just write code — they also:
- **Participate in designing and testing** digital solutions  
- **Collaborate** with other developers, designers, and clients  
- **Use AI tools** to speed up their work and improve code quality  

---

### 🤖 How Developers Use AI Tools

Modern developers often use AI to:
- **Generate ideas** or suggest ways to solve a problem  
- **Write and complete code** faster (code completion tools like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT)  
- **Debug and test** their programs more effectively  
- **Refactor or optimize** code to improve performance and readability  
- **Document** their work or explain complex code clearly  

AI tools act like smart assistants — they can propose solutions and automate routine tasks,  
but **developers must still think critically**, review results, and make final decisions.

> 💡 AI doesn’t replace developers — it **enhances their abilities** and helps them focus on creativity, problem-solving, and innovation.

**Web development can be divided into two main parts.**



## 🎨 Front-End Development
The **client-side** consists of everything users can see and interact with.  
This client-side of the application is called **Front End**.  
Front-End development builds this visible part of an application.  
Good examples of front-end work are **web sites** or **mobile interfaces**.

---

## 🧩 Back-End Development
The **server-side** handles everything that happens behind the scenes.  
These processes run on a machine called a **server** that cannot be freely accessed by users.  
The server-side is also called the **Back End**.  
Back-End development builds this part of the web application.  
Examples include **user login/logout** and **saving data for future use**.

---

## ⚙️ What About Full Stack
The web-development industry is evolving fast.  
Many positions require developers to work on both sides of an application.  
Developers who can handle both the Front End and the Back End are called **Full Stack Developers**.  
This means the developer needs good knowledge of both areas.  
Sometimes full-stack positions require stronger expertise in one side over the other.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Programmer? Developer? What’s the difference?**  
**A:** A *programmer* focuses on writing code. A *developer* designs complete solutions — from planning and building to testing and improving.  
In practice, most people do a bit of both.

---

**Q: Should I become a developer?**  
**A:** Yes, if you enjoy solving problems, creating things, and learning how technology works.  
If you like logic, puzzles, or creativity, development can be a great fit!

---

**Q: Do I need special Computer Science education?**  
**A:** Not strictly. Many great developers are self-taught.  
What matters most is curiosity, persistence, and continuous learning.

---

**Q: I get the diploma, and I am done — right?**  
**A:** No. Not even close 😄  
Technology evolves fast — developers keep learning throughout their careers.

---

**Q: Do I need special AI education?**  
**A:** Not necessarily. You just need to understand how to use AI tools responsibly and effectively.  
This course gives you that foundation.

---

**Q: Can AI replace developers?**  
**A:** No — AI can **assist**, not **replace**.  
It helps developers write code faster, find bugs, and explore ideas, but it can’t understand context, creativity, or human goals the way you can.  
The best developers learn to **collaborate with AI**, not compete with it.

> 💡 AI is a powerful tool — but the most important intelligence in programming is still *yours*.
