## 🖥️ Communication with Machines
- A communication is done by knowing the same language.  
- Two people can communicate if they know a common language.  
- Machines have languages as well.  
- There are languages that are common to programmers and machines.  
- These languages are the tools of every developer.  
- Developers use programming languages to write code and communicate a solution to the machines, which execute it really fast and precise.

## 💬 What Are Programming Languages?
- A **programming language** is a formal language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer.  
- A programming language has its own **syntax**.  
- Programming languages are used to create programs and control the behavior of machines.  
- Programming languages are the way we “talk” to computers — and sometimes to each other.  
- Programming languages can be **high-level** or **low-level**.

## 🔄 The Flow of an Expression
The flow of how an expression is processed by a machine goes through multiple layers — from high-level instructions down to machine-level execution.

## 🧪 The Development Process
When building an application, we go through a process called the **development process**.  
This process consists of phases that focus on different aspects of solving the problem and creating a software solution.  

There are many roles in the development process, not just developers.  
Everybody has a common goal: **creating an efficient and solid solution**.

## 🧮 Task I
Write a simple program that makes a **Miles ↔ Kilometers** conversion.  
- 1 Mile = 1.60934 Km  
- 1 Km = 0.621371 Miles  

⏳ Time to complete: 10 – 15 minutes.


### 🤖 AI Assistance
- Ask an AI tool (like ChatGPT or Copilot) to:  
  - “Explain step by step how to build a conversion program between miles and kilometers.”  
  - “Write example pseudocode or a simple code snippet in a beginner-friendly language.”
- Evaluate the AI’s response:
  - ✅ Is the logic correct?  
  - ⚠️ Are there any steps missing?  
  - 🧠 Can you rewrite the code in your own way?
- Rewrite or adjust the AI’s code so it matches your own understanding.

---

## 🧮 Task II
Write a program that finds the **average of 3 inputs** and prints it out.  

⏳ Time to complete: 10 – 15 minutes.

### 🤖 AI Assistance
- Prompt AI:  
  - “Write pseudocode to calculate the average of three numbers.”  
  - “Explain why dividing by 3 gives the result.”
- Compare your formula with AI’s explanation.

### 🧠 Reflection
- How close was your logic to the AI’s?  
- Did AI format its solution in a more structured way?

---

## 🧮 Task III
Write a program that finds a specific **name of a student** out of a collection of students.  
- The collection of students only has names in it.  
- If the program finds the name → print it.  
- If it does not find it → print “No student by that name.”

⏳ Time to complete: 15 – 20 minutes.


### 🤖 AI Assistance
- Prompt AI:  
  - “Write pseudocode for searching a name in an array.”  
  - “Explain how the loop and condition work.”
- Check how AI iterated through the collection.

### 🧠 Reflection
- Did AI use a linear search?  
- Could your solution be made more efficient?

## 🧮 Task 9000
Given these coin denominations:  
```
1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 20¢, 50¢
```
Find the smallest number of coins needed for a given amount.  
You do not need to list out which coins are used.

**Example 1:** For 375 cents → 9 coins are needed.  
**Example 2:** For 543 cents → 15 coins are needed.  

⏳ Time to complete: 20 – 25 minutes.

### 🤖 AI Assistance
- Prompt AI:  
  - “Write pseudocode for finding the minimum number of coins for a given amount using these denominations.”  
  - “Explain why this approach works.”
- Compare AI’s greedy algorithm with your steps.

### 🧠 Reflection
- Did AI use a greedy method (largest coins first)?  
- How could this algorithm be adapted for different currencies?
