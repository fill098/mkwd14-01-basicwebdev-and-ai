# 🌟 **Homework Project: “My Favorite Hobby” Webpage**

## 🎯 **Goal**

Create a single HTML page that introduces your favorite hobby. The page must include headings, paragraphs, text formatting, a navigation list, internal and external links, and basic page structure.

---

# 📋 **Requirements**

### **1. Basic Page Structure**

Your file should include:

* Doctype declaration
* `<html>`
* `<head>` with a title
* `<body>`

*(Tip: This is the foundation of every HTML document.)*

---

### **2. Headings**

Use at least **two different heading levels**:

* One main title
* Additional section titles

*(Tip: Add unique IDs to section headings for navigation.)*

---

### **3. Paragraphs**

Write **at least two paragraphs** describing your hobby.

**One paragraph must include an external link** as a reference.

*(Tip: Add it naturally, like “I learned more about this technique from…”.)*

---

### **4. Text Formatting**

Use **at least three** formatting styles, such as:

* bold
* italic
* underline
* highlight
* line break

*(Tip: Use formatting only when it helps meaning, not just decoration.)*

---

### **5. Navigation List**

Place a list at the top of the page that acts as a **table of contents**.

* Each list item should include a link
* Each link must jump to a section on the same page
* Use IDs on your headings

*(Tip: This creates simple page navigation, just like in Wikipedia articles.)*

---

### **6. External Hyperlink**

Include **one extra external hyperlink** somewhere on the page (separate from the one inside the paragraph).

*(Tip: This could be a beginner tutorial or a page about your hobby.)*

---

### **7. Section Divider**

Add at least one horizontal line to visually separate sections.

---

### **8. Second Page**

Create a **second simple HTML page** and link to it from your main page.

*(Tip: Even a simple “Thank you for visiting” page is fine.)*
