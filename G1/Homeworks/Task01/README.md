# **HTML Periodic Table Requirements 🧪📘**

## **1. Use of Basic Table Tags 🧱**

The periodic table must be created using **simple HTML table tags**:

* `<table>` for the main table
* `<tr>` for each row
* `<td>` for each cell containing an element
* `<th>` for labeling sections (optional)
* `<caption>` for a table title (optional)

**Requirement:**
The table layout must be built entirely using rows and cells—no advanced layout methods.

## **2. Use of Text and Text-Formatting Tags ✍️**

Each element cell must include:

* **Element symbol** in bold
* **Element name** in normal text
* **Atomic number** in small text if desired

Useful formatting tags:

* Bold for the element symbol
* Italics for emphasis
* Small text for atomic numbers

**Requirement:**
Each cell must clearly show the atomic number, symbol, and name.

## **3. Link to External Information 🔗**

Each element must include a clickable link to a reliable website (such as a Wikipedia page).

**Requirements:**

* The link must be placed inside the element’s cell.
* It must open in a new tab so users don't lose their place.

---

## **4. Color-Coding the Elements 🎨**

Each element type (noble gases, halogens, alkali metals, etc.) must have its own background color.

**Requirements:**

* Colors must be applied with simple inline styling.
* Each category must use a different color.
* Beginner-friendly color names should be used (like “lightblue” or “pink”).

---

## **5. Optional: Color Legend Explanation 🗂️**

A legend is **not required**, but if included, it should explain what each color represents.

**How the legend helps:**

* It shows which color belongs to which element group.
* It makes your table easier to understand at a glance.
* It can be placed above or below the table.
* It can be written using simple text or colored markers.

This is just an optional improvement that can make the table look more complete.

## **6.  Requirements 🌱**

* Must be written using basic HTML only (no CSS files or JavaScript).
* All styling should be done directly in the HTML.
* A perfectly accurate periodic layout is not necessary; a simplified version is fine.
* Include enough elements to demonstrate the design (at least several).
