## 💡 What Is Problem Solving
- A problem is an obstacle between your current state and your goal.  
- Problem-solving is the process of finding a way to reach your goal.  
- Programming is a way of solving problems using machines.  
- The process of solving problems with a computer involves understanding the problem, planning a solution, and implementing the plan.
- Problems are all around us.  
- Problem solving is a natural reaction to everyday issues: 
    - If a street is blocked, we find another route.  
    - If our phone runs out of battery, we put it on a charger.

## 🍞 Let’s Decompose a Common Solution
**Exercise:** How would you buy a loaf of bread from the supermarket?  
Write down the steps of how you execute this solution.  
Be as detailed as possible and use logical decisions.

## 💻 What Is Programming?
Programming is the process of writing a sequence of instructions (algorithms) in a chosen language to be executed by a computer.  
It is part of creating software and applications.  
Programming implements solutions by writing code.  

We collaborate with the machine by:  
- Using programming to give instructions  
- Allowing the machine to execute them

## 👨‍💻 How Do Programmers Program?
Programmers analyze the problem, break it into manageable parts, and create a general solution for each piece.  
Computer problems can be solved through a single set of logical instructions, or by combining multiple sets to address complex problems.  
Complex software programs can contain thousands or millions of instructions and lines of code that, together, automate processes and create intelligent systems.

## 🧩 The Programming Mindset
- Willingness to experiment and tinker  
- Acceptance that mistakes and issues happen every single day  
- Understanding that improvement is not linear  
- Thinking in small steps instead of trying to solve everything at once  
- Staying motivated even when facing mistakes or uncertainty  

---

## 🧠 How Programmers Usually Solve Problems
- Read and test the code to pinpoint the issue  
- Try solutions that worked in the past  
- Ask **AI** for assitance  
- Ask coworkers for assistance 


---

## 🧭 Problem Solving Steps
1. Understand the problem  
2. Plan the solution  
3. Execute the plan  
4. Review and improve  

---

## 🎯 Understanding the Problem
- What is being asked?  
- What are the inputs?  
- What are the outputs?  
- Are there any special conditions or constraints?

---

## 🧩 Planning the Solution
- Have you seen a similar problem before?  
- Can you reuse a related problem or part of it?  
- Focus on the unknown and relate it to a similar problem.  
- Break down the problem into smaller steps  
- Think about how to solve each step  
- Decide which data structures and algorithms to use  

---

## ⚙️ Executing the Plan
- Carry out the solution plan.  
- Work on one part of the problem at a time.  
- Start with minimum requirements and build from there.  
- Verify that each step is correct.  
- Ensure you can prove each step’s correctness.  

---

## 🔍 Looking Back at the Solution
- Test the solution for flaws.  
- Check if the solution is usable.  
- Validate results through alternative methods.  
- Determine if the method can be reused for similar problems.

## 🤖 Practice Task: Problem Solving with AI

**Goal:** Apply problem-solving steps and see how AI can assist in everyday tasks.

### Task: Planning a Healthy Snack for the Week

Imagine you want to plan **a healthy snack for each day of the week**.  
Use the problem-solving steps you learned:

1. **Understand the problem:**  
   - Goal: 7 healthy snacks for 7 days  
   - Constraints: easy to prepare, ingredients you likely have at home  
   - Output: a list of snacks with a short explanation for each  

2. **Plan the solution:**  
   - Break down the task: brainstorm snack ideas → check ingredients → assign to each day  
   - Decide how to organize your plan (list, table, or schedule)

3. **Execute the plan:**  
   - Try brainstorming snack ideas manually first  
   - Then **ask an AI assistant** to suggest snack options

**Example Prompt to AI:**  
> “Give me 7 healthy and easy-to-make snack ideas for someone who studies and works part-time. Include one sentence explaining why each snack is healthy.”

4. **Review and Improve:**  
   - Are the suggestions realistic?  
   - Do they match your constraints?  
   - Can you adjust your prompt to get better or more creative ideas?
